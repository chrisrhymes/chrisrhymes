### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Rhymes and I'm a fullstack web developer, specialising in PHP and JavaScript, using Laravel, React and Next.js.

I also enjoy creating Jekyll themes, such as [Bulma Clean Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme) and [Mere Blog Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/mere-blog-theme).

## Books

As well as being a developer, I also enjoy writing. I am currently working on a cozy mystery series called 'The Little-Astwick Mysteries'.

More information is available on [the littleastwick.co.uk website](https://www.littleastwick.co.uk).

Alternatively, follow me on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@chrisrhymes) or [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@csrhymes).
